# Morabaraba-9001
SOLID OOP Implementation of Morabaraba Rhodes CS3

# Application
This is a console application written in C#.

# Side Notes
1 - To pull "master" into a branch (e.g. prototype_type_system) for bringing any changes in "master" into an external branch (in the project git repo. folder console):
```
git checkout prototype_type_system
git fetch origin
git merge origin/master
```
Fix any conflicts, create a new commit. When fixing changes it will have a suggested commit message, we can just leave it. Then "git push" that branch so github has those changes.
